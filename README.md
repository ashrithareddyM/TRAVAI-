# TRAVIA
This Flask-based Travel Assistant Bot is a simple web application that helps users plan their trips by offering destination suggestions, packing lists, and budget estimates based on the type of travel they choose. When a user selects an option like "Suggest Destination," "Show Packing List," or "Estimate Budget" and provides a travel type (e.g., beach, adventure, culture, or wildlife), the app responds accordingly. It may recommend a random location from a relevant category, generate a list of essential items to pack, or calculate an approximate travel budget based on the number of days and daily expenses. The output is displayed interactively on the same page, providing a friendly, helpful travel chatbot experience through a clean and user-friendly interface.
